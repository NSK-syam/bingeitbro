## 🎓 Learnings & Insights

### Technical Challenges Overcome
1. **Supabase Auth Deadlock** - Learned about navigator.locks API
2. **Postgres OOM** - Mastered RLS optimization
3. **OAuth Flows** - Deep dive into PKCE and auth callbacks
4. **Edge Computing** - Cloudflare Workers vs Vercel Edge
5. **International Performance** - TMDB proxy for low-latency

### What Went Well ✅
- Rapid prototyping with Next.js 16
- Clean separation of concerns (components, hooks, lib)
- Comprehensive documentation from day 1
- Proactive debugging (good error logging)

### What Could Be Better 🔄
- More testing (no automated tests yet)
- Earlier performance optimization (TMDB proxy should've been earlier)
- Better branch management (mostly committed to main)
