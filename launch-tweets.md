### Reddit Post (r/moviesuggestions):
```
[Project] I built a platform for sharing movie recommendations with friends (not algorithms)

Hey r/moviesuggestions!

I noticed we all trust friend recommendations way more than any algorithm, but there wasn't a good platform built specifically for that. So I made one.

**Binge It Bro** - bingeitbro.com

What it does:
- Share movie recommendations with personal notes to friends
- Make your movie collection public (optional)
- Get email notifications when friends send recommendations
- Schedule movies to watch when you're free
- Direct links to Netflix, Prime, Disney+, and 20+ platforms
- Supports 10+ languages including English, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada

It's completely free and I built it because I was tired of scrolling Netflix for 30 mins just to give up.

Would love to hear your feedback! 🍿

## My Recommendation:

Use **Option 1** (Feature-Focused) for the main launch tweet. It's comprehensive, clear, and has strong CTA.

Then follow up with **Option 3** (Short & Punchy) the next day to catch different timezone audiences.

If you want maximum reach, do **Option 5** (Thread Format) - threads get more engagement and Twitter's algorithm loves them.
