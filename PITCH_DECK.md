# BiB — Binge It Bro  
## Investor Pitch

**One-line:** BiB is the social layer for what to watch — friends’ recommendations, not algorithms.

---

## 1. The Problem

- **Too much content, no trusted signal.** Streaming catalogs are huge; users spend more time choosing than watching. Generic “For You” feeds feel impersonal and miss what actually fits their mood and taste.
- **Recommendations are scattered.** Friends text links, share in group chats, or post on social — none of it is organized, searchable, or tied to *why* someone loved a film.
- **No bridge between social and streaming.** People still ask “what should I watch?” and get fragmented answers. There’s no single place that combines *who* recommended it, *why*, and *where* to watch.

---

## 2. The Solution

**BiB turns your friends into your recommendation engine.**

- **Friend-first discovery:** See what people you trust have recommended, with personal notes, mood tags, and “watch with” context.
- **Mood + language picker (“What to Watch”):** Pick how you feel and your language; we surface the best match from your friends’ picks — no infinite scrolling.
- **Social graph of taste:** Add friends, get recommendations in a dedicated inbox, track what you’ve watched, and keep a watchlist. Nudges remind you of unwatched friend picks.

We’re not replacing Netflix or Prime — we’re the **decision layer** on top of them: “*Who* says watch this, *why*, and *where* it’s available.”

## 3. Product (What We’ve Built)

- **Live product:** [bingeitbro.com](https://bingeitbro.com) — Next.js 16, React 19, Supabase (auth + DB), TMDB for metadata and OTT availability.
- **Core flows:**
  - **Recommend:** Add a movie/series with a personal note, mood, rating, and OTT links; share directly to a friend.
  - **Discover:** Trending and today’s OTT releases (USA + India), filters (genre, language, year, type), and a “What to Watch” mood/language picker.
  - **Social:** Friends list, profile pages, Top 10 lists, friend recommendation inbox with notifications.
- **Differentiation:** OTT-only (streaming), 10+ languages (English + Indian languages), 20+ OTT platforms with clickable logos, and a focus on USA + India streaming availability.

---

## 4. Market

- **Streaming fatigue + discovery pain:** Global streaming market is massive; discovery and “what to watch” are unsolved. Social recommendation is a wedge into that behavior.
- **Target users:**  
  - Primary: Young adults and families who already rely on friends for movie picks (word-of-mouth, WhatsApp, etc.).  
  - Secondary: Language-specific audiences (e.g. Telugu, Hindi, Tamil) underserved by global algorithms.
- **TAM/SAM/SOM:** We’re going after the “social discovery” slice of the streaming and entertainment market — users who value trusted, human recommendations over pure algo feeds.

---

## 5. Business Model (Potential)

- **Phase 1 (current):** Grow usage and retention; prove engagement and repeat “What to Watch” usage.
- **Monetization options:**  
  - **OTT / studio partnerships:** Affiliate or promoted placements when we drive “where to watch” clicks.  
  - **Premium:** Deeper filters, watch stats, custom Top 10 themes, or early access to features.  
  - **B2B:** White-label “friend recommendations” or “mood picker” for streamers, telcos, or content apps.

---

## 6. Traction & Milestones

- **Product:** Shipped full-stack app with auth, friends, recommendations, watchlist, watched tracking, and mood-based picker.
- **Tech:** Deployed on Vercel, connected to GitHub for CI/CD; Supabase for scale; TMDB for rich metadata.
- **Next:** User acquisition, retention metrics, and feedback to prioritize partnerships or premium features.

---

## 7. Competition

- **Aggregators (JustWatch, Reelgood):** Focus on “where to watch” and catalog; not social or friend-centric.
- **Social (Letterboxd, IMDb):** Reviews and lists; not built around *sending* and *receiving* recommendations from a closed friend graph with mood/context.
- **Streamers’ own UX:** In-app discovery is algorithmic and impersonal. BiB sits *above* the streamers as the social decision layer.

**BiB’s edge:** Only product that combines (1) friend graph, (2) personal “why” and mood, (3) OTT availability, and (4) a simple “What to Watch” moment (mood + language → one good pick).

---

## 8. Vision

- **Short term:** Become the default “ask your friends what to watch” product for our early communities (e.g. Indian language + English bilinguals, friend groups who already share recommendations).
- **Medium term:** Integrations or partnerships with streamers/telcos so BiB’s “friend pick” and “where to watch” flow lives where users already are.
- **Long term:** The social recommendation layer for all streaming — the place you go when you want to *decide* what to watch, before you open any app.
